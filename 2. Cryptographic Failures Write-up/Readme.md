**Completed: 6/17/2025**

OWASP Top 10 are the top 10 researched and documented web application vulnerabilities currently known.

Today I will be studying the second one - Cryptographic Failure using the TryHackMe platform to study.

Today I will be studying the second one - Cryptographic Failures using the TryHackMe
platform to study.

**Cryptographic Failures** is the misuse (or lack of use) of cryptographic algorithms for protecting sensitive information.

**Cryptographic failures** occur when developers fail to use strong or proper encryption. This can happen due to improper implementation, misconfiguration, or the improper use of cryptographic algorithms, protocols, or key management practices. The mistake leaves sensitive data (e.g., passwords, credit card details, personal messages, or usernames and passwords) exposed to adversaries for exploitation.

**Examples of What Can Go Wrong:**
- A website saves your password without hiding it — a hacker can see it clearly.
- Your personal info is sent over the internet without protection, and someone could intercept it.
- A company uses weak encryption that is easy to break.
