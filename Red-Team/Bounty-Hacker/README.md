Starting of with an Nmap scan, I discovered three open ports:

- 21 (FTP) - vsftpd 3.0.3
- 22 (SSH) - penSSH 7.2p2 Ubuntu 4ubuntu2.8 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
- 80 (HTTP) - Apache httpd 2.4.18 ((Ubuntu))

Navigating to the IP address in a browser loaded a webpage featuring a dialogue between four characters: Spike, Jet, Ed, and Faye, alongside a background image.

Inspecting the pageâ€™s source code revealed a reference to a file named `crew.jpg`. I downloaded it using the `curl -O` command.

I tried using Steghide and a few other tools to see if there was any hidden data or metadata in the image, but didnâ€™t uncover anything useful.

I circled back to Nmap to gather a more detailed network scan and learned that the FTP service allowed anonymous login (ftp-anon).

After successfully logging into the FTP server with the default anonymous credentials, I listed the available files using the `ls` command and found two downloadable `.txt` files. I then used the `get` command to retrieve them.

Viewing the contents with `cat` showed that `locks.txt` contained what looked like a list of passwords, while `task.txt` mentioned a potential username: `lin`.

With that information, I used Hydra to brute-force the SSH login credentials, combining the `lin` username with the password list, and it worked. I was able to recover a probable password.

From there, I logged into the server via SSH as lin and successfully captured the first `user.txt` flag for the room!

I followed up with the `sudo -l` command to see what commands Lin could run with root privileges and discovered Iâ€™d be able to exploit the `/bin/tar` binary. 

After some research, I learned more about the command needed to exploit this vulnerability:
```
sudo /bin/tar -cf /dev/null /dev/null --checkpoint=1 --checkpoint-action=exec=/bin/sh
```

This command tells `tar` to:

- Create an archive (`-cf`) to `/dev/null`

- Triggers a checkpoint, which executes `/bin/sh`

- Since it runs with `sudo`, the shell is launched with root privileges

Entering the command successfully granted root access. From there, I used the `python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'` command to stabilize the shell and obtained the final `root.txt` file located within the root directory. - Room complete!

Out of curiosity, I also tried using Linâ€™s password with Steghide to access the hidden contents of `crew.jpg`but had no luck, it was worth a try.

**Lessons Learned**

This room taught me that Hydra can also be used to brute-force SSH services, which I hadnâ€™t tried before. It was also a good refresher on basic FTP enumeration and using anonymous login as a potential entry point.

ðŸ”’ Out of respect for the learning experience, Iâ€™ve chosen not to share the flag answers directly. Instead, Iâ€™ve documented my full process to support both others and myself in understanding the vulnerability.
