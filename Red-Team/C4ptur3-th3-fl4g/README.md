[![Day 30 of 30 – Hack Documentation Challenge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Day%2030%20of%2030-Hack%20Documentation%20Challenge-4CAF50?style=for-the-badge&logo=tryhackme)](https://tryhackme.com)

**Challenge Completed:** 8/14/2025

“A beginner level CTF challenge
Translate, shift and decode the following;
Answers are all case sensitive.”

<p align="center">+++++++++</p>

**<p align="center">Task 1: Translating & Shifting</p>**

The first question seemed self-explanatory:
```
1. c4n y0u c4p7u23 7h3 f149?
```
A: `can you capture the flag?`

```
2. 01101100 01100101 01110100 01110011 00100000 01110100 01110010 01111001 00100000 01110011 01101111 01101101 01100101 00100000 01100010 01101001 01101110 01100001 01110010 01111001 00100000 01101111 01110101 01110100 00100001
```
This code is binary so I used an online binary-to-text translator to translate the message.

A: `lets try some binary out!`

```
3. MJQXGZJTGIQGS4ZAON2XAZLSEBRW63LNN5XCA2LOEBBVIRRHOM======
```
At first glance, this looks like Base64, but it’s actually Base32.

A: `base32 is super common in CTF's`

```
4. RWFjaCBCYXNlNjQgZGlnaXQgcmVwcmVzZW50cyBleGFjdGx5IDYgYml0cyBvZiBkYXRhLg==
```
This one is Base64. Each Base64 digit represents exactly 6 bits of data.

A: `Each Base64 digit represents exactly 6 bits of data.`

```
5. 68 65 78 61 64 65 63 69 6d 61 6c 20 6f 72 20 62 61 73 65 31 36 3f
```
This appears to be hexadecimal (base16). Interesting way to make you think!
 
A: `hexadecimal or base16?`

```
6. Ebgngr zr 13 cynprf!
```
Seeing the “r” close to the 13 made me guess this is a ROT13 cipher.

A: `Rotate me 13 places!`

```
7. *@F DA:? >6 C:89E C@F?5 323J C:89E C@F?5 Wcf E:>6DX
```
This…hmm, according to Cipher Identifier, it’s a ROT-47 cipher.

A: `You spin me right round baby right round (47 times)`

```
8. - . .-.. . -.-. --- -- -- ..- -. .. -.-. .- - .. --- -.
. -. -.-. --- -.. .. -. --.
```
This looks like morse code.

A: `telecommunication encoding`

```
9. 85 110 112 97 99 107 32 116 104 105 115 32 66 67 68
```
This looks like a more advanced hexadecimal, but it’s decimal ASCII code.

A: `Unpack this BCD`

```
10.

This one looked insane at first, and I had no clue where to start. So I had to get some help with this one, but apparently decimal ASCII, encoded with ROT47, binary, Morse code, and Base64 results in this massive piece of code. Clever, thank you, CyberChef!

A: `Let's make this a bit trickier…`

![Alt text](1)

**<p align="center">Task 2: Spectrograms</p>**

This task involved an audio file with a hidden message, which could be translated using Sonic Visualiser.

![Alt text](2)

Following the instructions, I downloaded the file to my attack box and made it executable using the `chmod +x` command then launched the application.

![Alt text](3)

Within the application, I opened the audio file.

![Alt text](4)

Next, I right-clicked and added the spectrogram feature to the audio segment.

![Alt text](5)

Once applied, the hidden message was revealed, super cool!

![Alt text](6)

**<p align="center">Task 3: Steganography</p>**

Downloading the task file provided a `.jpeg` image named `stegosteg.jpg`. Using the `steghide` command:
```
steghide extract -sf stegosteg.jpg
```

without a password successfully extracted a .txt file named `steganopayload2248.txt`.
Viewing the file with:
```
cat steganopayload2248.txt
```
revealed the answer to the task.

![Alt text](7)

**<p align="center">Task 4: Security through obscurity</p>**

For this task, downloading the file gave a `.jpeg` image named `Meme`.

Simply using the `cat` command:
```
cat Meme.jpeg
```
revealed the final answers to the room!

![Alt text](8)

**Lessons Learned**

This room marks the last room of my 30-day personal pentesting documentation challenge. This lit a spark in me that will not just end here. I’m extremely proud of myself and grateful to the Most High for keeping me driven and consistent throughout this whole process. Completing this journey reinforced my technical skills, from decoding complex ciphers and encodings to extracting hidden data through steganography, while also strengthening my patience, persistence, and problem-solving abilities. Each challenge reminded me that growth comes from both curiosity and dedication. I’m excited to carry this momentum forward, continuing to explore cybersecurity, deepen my knowledge, and embrace every opportunity to learn and create with intention. Anything is possible!

Thank you for reading!

🔒 Out of respect for the learning experience, I’ve chosen not to share the flag answers directly. Instead, I’ve documented my full process to support both others and myself in understanding the vulnerability.
