# OWASP Top 10 â€“ 2021

This directory contains my personal write-ups for each of the OWASP Top 10 Web Application Security Risks, based on hands-on labs completed through TryHackMe. Each folder includes practical notes, exploitation steps, screenshots, and reflections to reinforce my understanding of each vulnerability.

This project is part of my ongoing cybersecurity learning journey, with a focus on web application penetration testing.
