Beginning with an Nmap scan on the target IP `10.10.187.180` revealed two open ports:

- 22 (SSH)
- 80 (HTTP)

Navigating to the IP in a browser brought up a Lo-Fi Music homepage with multiple embedded YouTube links.

Viewing the source code, the hrefs with `/?page=` parameters looked the most interesting since they indicate the site is dynamically including content based on a `GET` parameter called *page*.

Testing the URL parameter with directory traversal `../` had promising results, indicating the webserver might be vulnerable to Local File Inclusion.

Next, the `/?page=` parameter was tested with `../../../../etc/passwd`, which revealed multiple user accounts on the server, including root.

Unfortunately, navigating to the `../../../../root/root.txt`path did not give a flag.

However, viewing the `flag.txt` file did!

**Lessons Learned**

This room was a great refresher on how easily a web serverâ€™s directory can be traversed using URL parameters if proper user input validation is missing. I havenâ€™t used this method in a while so it was fun to revisit.

ðŸ”’ Out of respect for the learning experience, Iâ€™ve chosen not to share the flag answers directly. Instead, Iâ€™ve documented my full process to support both others and myself in understanding the vulnerability.
