ðŸ”’ Topic: Security Logging and Monitoring Failures (OWASP A09 - 2021)

<p align="center">+++++++++</p>

Security Logging and Monitoring Failures are vulnerabilities in web applications where important security events are not properly recorded or monitored. These events can include failed logins, suspicious activity, or system errors. Without strong logging and alerting, attackers can break in, move around, or steal data without being noticed.

**Why it matters:**

If there's no record of whatâ€™s happening or no alerts when something suspicious occurs, security teams wonâ€™t know there's a problem until itâ€™s too late.

**Example:**

If someone repeatedly tries to guess passwords and the web application doesnâ€™t log those failed attempts or alert anyone, an attacker could brute-force a login unnoticed.

**What logs should include:**
- HTTP status codes
- Time Stamps
- Usernames
- API endpoints/page locations
- IP addresses

**Signs of suspicious activity:**
- **Too many failed login attempts** or trying to access things like admin pages without permission.
  
- **Requests coming from strange IP addresses or locations**, which could mean someone else is trying to break into an account (though sometimes it's just a false alarm).

- **Very fast or unusual requests**, which might mean someone is using automated tools like bots or scripts.

- **Known attack patterns**, like specific code or commands attackers often use to test for weaknesses in a site.

Following the THM lab instructions, I downloaded the task file. This is the sample file Iâ€™ll be examining.

The logs show dated records of successful and redirected login attempts from multiple users along with their IP addresses.

The unauthorized redirects are associated with the IP address 49.99.13.16, while the rest of the login attempts in the logs appear to be successful logins from different IP addresses linked to legitimate users. There were four unauthorized redirect attempts from the same IP address, each happening every five minutes. This pattern suggests a brute force attack where the attacker may be trying to gradually increase privileges from admin to root.

The security issue here comes from monitoring: if no one is actively checking the logs or if thereâ€™s no alert system for suspicious activity, these unauthorized redirect attempts could go unnoticed. This repeated activity demonstrates a clear pattern that security monitoring should catch, but without proper monitoring or alerts, it would remain undetected. As a result, an attacker could potentially escalate privileges undetected, which is exactly the type of risk OWASPâ€™s Security Logging and Monitoring Failures highlight.

**Lessons Learned:**

This lab reminded me how essential proper security logging and monitoring are for quickly detecting and responding to attacks. Without detailed logs and timely alerts, suspicious activities like repeated unauthorized redirects and privilege escalations can go unnoticed, allowing attackers to take control of critical parts of the system. It showcased how valuable logs are for fully understanding and investigating security incidents.
