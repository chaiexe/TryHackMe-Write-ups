üì¢ Hacking into Windows via EternalBlue, Blue badge included after completing this room‚ÄºÔ∏è

<p align="center">+++++++++</p>

Starting the room off with an `Nmap -sV -Pn` scan uncovered three open ports with a port number under 1000:

- 135/tcp   open  msrpc        Microsoft Windows RPC
- 139/tcp   open  netbios-ssn  Microsoft Windows netbios-ssn
- 445/tcp   open  microsoft-ds Microsoft Windows 7 - 10 microsoft-ds (workgroup: WORKGROUP)

Since common web ports like 80 or 443 were not open, there's no need to attempt accessing the IP via a web browser. The presence of port 445 (SMB) immediately stands out as a potential attack vector, especially given the room's name (Blue), hinting at the EternalBlue (MS17-010) vulnerability.
