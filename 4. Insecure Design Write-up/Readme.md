**Insecure design** happens when the foundation or structure of an application is flawed in a way that creates security risks. Itâ€™s not about coding mistakes or misconfigurations, but rather about poor planning or missing safeguards built into the system from the beginning.
Itâ€™s like building a house without locks on the doors. The locks were never broken, but no one ever thought to add them in the first place.

**Remediation:**

Because insecure design issues are introduced early in the development process, fixing them often means going back and reworking the affected part of the application entirely. This makes them harder to fix compared to typical coding bugs. The best way to prevent these types of vulnerabilities is by doing proper threat modeling during the early stages of development.
