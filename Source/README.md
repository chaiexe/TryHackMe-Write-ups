**Topic:** Web application pentesting 

**Completed:** 7/8/2025

üéØ**Objective:** ‚ÄúExploit a recent vulnerability and hack Webmin, a web-based system configuration tool.‚Äù - THM

<p align="center">+++++++++</p>

Beginning with an Nmap scan on the target IP 10.10.34.213 revealed two open ports:
- 22 (SSH)
- 10000 (HTP)

Navigating to the webpage prompts an error message ‚ÄúUnable to connect‚Äù, hinting there must be another way to connect to the server.

According to Tenable, there is a reported Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability for Webmin versions 1.882 to 1.921. The target 10.10.34.213 is running Webmin version 1.890.

Using Metasploit to search for the known CVE:2019-15107 led me to the `linux/http/webmin_backdoor` module.

To properly configure the exploit, I set:
- `SSL` to `true` (since Webmin runs over HTTPS),
- `ForceExploit` to `true` to bypass Metasploit‚Äôs internal check, and  
- I selected the payload `cmd/unix/reverse_netcat` for personal preference and easier shell interaction.

After modifying the options, I successfully ran the exploit and received an unstable Netcat shell.

Next, the golden commands `export TERM-xterm` & `python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")' were used to successfully stabilize the shell as `root`.

The command `cat /etc/passwd/ | grep /home` was used to locate any user accounts with a `/home` directory. Out of the two that were found, the user `Dark` looked the most intriguing.

Using the command `su - [SUID]` to switch to the `Dark` user‚Äôs account allowed me to locate the `user.txt` file located in the user‚Äôs home directory.

Since I initially was root, I restarted the exploit session to get back to `root` user and located the final flag using the `/root/root.txt` command.

Mission accomplished!!

<p align="center">üïπÔ∏èNotable Commands LearnedüïπÔ∏è</p>

1) This command helps stabilize the shell‚Äôs terminal behavior. It removes and glitches with the display, colors, and input handling, making the user experience smoother to use.
```
export TERM=xterm
```
2) This command allows for a nicer interactive shell if Python is installed on the system.
```
python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```
3) This command helps to see what user you currently are.
```
id
```
4) This command lists all executable files on the system that run with elevated privileges (SUID) 
```
find / -perm -4000 -type f 2>/dev/null
```
5) Lists normal user accounts who have a home directory under `/home`, which is where you‚Äôll often find user flags, SSH keys, bash history.
```
cat /etc/passwd | grep /home
```
6) Command switches the user to whatever SUID chosen
```
su - [SUID]
```

**Lessons Learned**

This lab was a refresher of using Metasploit. I got more comfortable with setting exploits, configuring payloads, and understanding how Metasploit handles listeners on its own. I ran into a shell that gave no prompt, which reminded me how useful `python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'` and `export TERM=xterm` are for stabilizing access. I also revisited SUID enumeration with `find / -perm -4000 -type f 2>/dev/null` and reviewed how `pkexec` can be a potential vector for privilege escalation via the PwnKit vulnerability. But in the end, I remembered I already had a root shell from an earlier session, and used it to grab the root flag. üòÑ

üîí Out of respect for the learning experience, I‚Äôve chosen not to share the flag answers
directly. Instead, I‚Äôve documented my full process to support both others and myself in
understanding the vulnerability.
